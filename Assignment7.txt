soundlibrary
//Aaryaman Jaising
//11/1/22
//Program to make a constructor for an array of sounds (soundlibrary), function to list the songs in the library, function to get number of sounds, function to play a sound.
// Time 1 hour, Bugs: Had some trouble reading in the values, then a problem was that I did not assign a length to the array of soundlibrary which cause a nullpoint error.

SoundBoard
//Aaryaman Jaising
//11/2/22
//Program to reuse menu function for user to select sound to play from soundlibrary
//Time:40 minutes, Bugs: Had to change old menu code because it would not work with quit, so TA suggested different while loop and I thought I could use recursion to get it to run again
